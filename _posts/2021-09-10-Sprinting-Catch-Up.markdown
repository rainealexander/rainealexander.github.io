# The Front End Capstone

## Phase 0: An Agile Beginning

Phase 0 began with meeting the team and coming up with a group name: *catlike-reactflexes* (the four of us thought it was pretty clever). Next we went though all of the setup steps; creating a organization on GitHub, making a Trello board to track progress, and the ever-important documentation review.

Each of us also had an important individual task to start an Engineering Journal! ( You're reading it right now :) )

There is a learning curve when starting a project with 3 others, but with good teamwork we were able to get the project set up. We now have a basic React app served with Node and Express to work from.

## Phase 1: Breaking It Down

Phase 1 began with each team member choosing a widget from the application to work on. The project assigned to us is a product details page similar to many online clothing retailers. The app was broken down into Product Overview, Related Products & Outfit, Questions & Answers, and Reviews.

Up to this point I had been trying to provide suggestions for planning and structuring the project to help things progress smoothly. I decided to choose the one critical component - Product Overview - to help take some of the pressure off others and continue in an informal planner/architect role.

Once everyone picked a widget, we moved on to Trello to start creating project tickets. Each widget needed to be broken down into its component parts and those given a time estimate. Finally the team set up a basic testing environment using Jest. Next it will be time to dive into coding!
