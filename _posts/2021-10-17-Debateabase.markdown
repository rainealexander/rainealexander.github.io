# Debating Databases

## Options and choices

### The Challenge

The goal of SDC is to create an API service based on the data from the frontend capstone project. The first step is to choose one SQL and one NoSQL database.

### Actions

Working from a list of possible options, I weighed the options of using a framework I was familiar with vs. learning something new. I also looked into the relative complexity of setting up various databases and using them with node.js

### Results

SQL - With a growing fondness for open source applications (likely stemming using Ubuntu for the Hack Reactor program), I decided to take on a small challenge to learn and use the PostgreSQL relational database system.

NoSQL - I have experience using MongoDB from previous sprints in the program, so I decided to stick with something I knew rather than learning something entirely new with Cassandra.
