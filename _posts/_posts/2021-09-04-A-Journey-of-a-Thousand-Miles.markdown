Starting something new has always been a difficult process for me. The perceived effort of beginning an unfamiliar task slowly builds until it feels like there is a mountain looming in front of me. Â According to the experts, much of this can be drawn back to ADHD:

> Emotions, positive and negative, play a critical role in executive functions: initiating and prioritizing tasks, sustaining or shifting interest or effort, holding thoughts in active memory, and choosing to avoid a task or situation. Whereas Google responds to queries typed into the search engine, the human brain responds to the quality and intensity of emotions attached to associated memories.

The human mind is a complicated thing. Even with my thirty-odd years living with mental disorders, some things never get easier. But this is a start.

Here I lay forth the prelude to my Engineering Journal. Like most good stories, we start in the middle. As I move into the Senior phase of the Hack Reactor bootcamp, my software engineering knowledge is put to the test for our first task: the Front End Capstone. We now transition to the world of agile development with a team of 4 working together on a single project. As always, there are new challenges and adaptations to be made.

Procrastination may be ~~fine~~ manageable when working alone, but should be avoided when three other people are working with you. I just have to remind myself to mitigate bad habits and bring my strengths to the table. I am excited to continue this journey and learn alongside others, and even find myself looking forward to continuing this journal now that it has begun.
